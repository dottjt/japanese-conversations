Hi, Julius! ありがとう
I started making videos mainly this year.
I was more focus on drawing at the beginning of this year though.
Thanks for watching my videos♪

今年の半ばごろから主に動画を作り始めました。

それまでは主に画を描いていました

That's amazing!
How do you find the time to make your videos?
I imagine it's very time consuming.
Are you a student?

すごい！
動画を作る時間どうやって見つけますか？
時間がかかると思います。
生徒がありますか？

Thanks for the correction! That's helpful!
Oh, the adverb "mainly" is better to put right after the subject but the "more" is better before the object.
I've been learning English so many years but I feel I will never be able to sound natural XD
That means I can have fun endlessly!!

Yes, it is time-consuming, probably much more than people usually imagine.
The good thing is, drawing one illustration feels much easier after a minute animated short is done.
I'm always struggling to find enough time to work on.
I am student forever ;)

Correction:
学生ですか？　Are you a student?

動画を作るのはとても時間がかかります。
でもやめられません。
